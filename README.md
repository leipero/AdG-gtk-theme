# AdG-gtk-theme
Slight gray modification of Adwaita theme from the GNOME Project.

This is still WIP, only Gnome 3 is supported.

Run "./configure" then "make" to generate the theme. Run "make install" as superuser to install the theme, and "make uninstall" to remove it.

Used from:
https://github.com/GNOME/gtk.git
